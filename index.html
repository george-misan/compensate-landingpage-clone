          <p>
            Compensate empowers individuals to combat climate change and turn
            their everyday purchase decisions into climate action. Compensate
            makes visible the impact of our products, services and lifestyle
            choices, sets a price for it and enables everyone to take
            responsibility for their emissions. When we know more, we’re able to
            think twice and choose wisely. And that way, we can truly
            revolutionize our daily habits and build a sustainable future.

              We know that there is too much CO2 in the atmosphere. Now we need
              radical cuts in CO2 emissions and to start removing carbon from
              the atmosphere. This must happen on a systematic level, and can
              already be done through carbon capture. But for the individual,
              it’s been difficult to access carbon capture tools and understand
              the actions necessary.

              service for individuals and together with forward-looking
              businesses, integrates compensation into the purchase flow of

              Compensate is a nonprofit foundation that channels 100% of
              compensation payments to certified, high-quality carbon capture
              projects. Compensate is constantly searching for the most
              effective and sustainable ways to compensate, with the guidance of
              leading climate scientists. With our builtin overcompensation,
              more carbon dioxide is always removed from the atmosphere than
              what a product, service or action creates.
