          <p>
            Compensate empowers individuals to combat climate change and turn
            their everyday purchase decisions into climate action. Compensate
            makes visible the impact of our products, services and lifestyle
            choices, sets a price for it and enables everyone to take
            responsibility for their emissions. When we know more, we’re able to
            think twice and choose wisely. And that way, we can truly
            revolutionize our daily habits and build a sustainable future.

              We know that there is too much CO2 in the atmosphere. Now we need
              radical cuts in CO2 emissions and to start removing carbon from
              the atmosphere. This must happen on a systematic level, and can
              already be done through carbon capture. But for the individual,
              it’s been difficult to access carbon capture tools and understand
              the actions necessary.

              Compensate is a nonprofit foundation that channels 100% of

              effective and sustainable ways to compensate, with the guidance of
              leading climate scientists. With our builtin overcompensation,
              more carbon dioxide is always removed from the atmosphere than
              what a product, service or action creates.

          <p>On April 24th 2019, Compensate was introduced to
            the world at the University of Helsinki. The Carbon
            negativity now! event brought together scientists,
            students, entrepreneurs, activists and other
            individuals interested in fighting climate change and
            was streamed online.
            Compensate made headlines in Helsingin Sanomat,
            Yle web and broadcast news, MTV3 broadcast
            shows, Kauppalehti, and various other national media
            outlets. The convenient and efficient Compensate
            tool was met with high enthusiasm and Compensate
            became a viral phenomenon: thousands of Finns
            measured their carbon footprints, social media filled
            with footprint results and businesses joined in the
            discussion eager to join the movement.
            The #WeCompensate family was born.</p>
